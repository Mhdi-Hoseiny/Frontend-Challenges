# Front-End Challenges

Group learning becomes personal learning and each person can achieve more learning.


## Why we do it

- Challenges are opportunities to learn
- Communications are opportunities to learn
- Reading other solutions and helping to improve them are opportunities to learn.

## File Structure

It's simple.
Every week there is a challenge and it has its own folder. You can see the description of that challenge in the CHALLENGE_NAME.md file.

```
week 01
├── react
│   └── ...usernames
├── javascript
│   └── ...usernames
└── CHALLENGE_NAME.md
```

## How to contribute

- **Solve approach**: Solve the challenge! And push your solution there in a folder with your GitHub username.
- **Help approach**: Read the solutions of other users and contribute to their improvement through the issues section.

## Principles

- Must be clean
- Must be formatted
- Must be a module
